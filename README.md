## Known Issue:
I'm currently facing a persistent problem where the server isn't getting listed. I've been diligently working on resolving this, but unfortunately, a solution has eluded me thus far. The detailed discussion of the issue can be found at this link. https://github.com/Ch4r0ne/ARK-Ascended-Server-Manager/discussions/1

In the meantime, I recommend checking out a similar project (on Debian 12) by my colleagues at https://github.com/cdp1337/ARKSurvivalAscended-Linux.
If the installation process doesn't work for you, which happened in my case as well, you can attempt the workaround suggested in this comment. https://github.com/cdp1337/ARKSurvivalAscended-Linux/issues/1#issuecomment-1786189928
After following the installation guide, make sure to adjust the start parameters as described. Once you've updated the values, you can proceed to start the service.
